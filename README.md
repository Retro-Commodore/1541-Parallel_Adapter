# 1541-Parallel_Adapter
This is an adapter to easier add a parallel port for the Commodore 1541 and 1541-II diskette drive.
You can (and should) read more on Peter's site https://ist.uwaterloo.ca/~schepers/1541par.html

Item list.
* 15CM 10 wire flatcable.
  * or 8 wire flatcable for ZoomFloppy.
* 15pin D-sub female(not the VGA type connector), either solder or for IDC ribbon cable (last one recommended).
* 40 pins IC socket.
* 2 x 20 pins sil header male-male. (turned/tulip recommended).

All items can be found on eBay or your favorite electronics pusher.

**Let the PCB be as thin as possible, otherwise you need thicker washers. Testet is a 0.8mm thick adapter. **

Washers are needed for the 1541-II drive to lift the mechanical parts.
1.6mm (2 x 0.8mm) height with an inner diameter of 4mm is just sufficient to lift the drive.
It hasn't been physically testet on a 1541 drive, if you're intending to use this drive, let me know how it fits, so I can update this document.

Connecting the adapter to ZoomFloppy is described below, if you need to connect the drive to a C64, you should visit Peter's site for more help.


On 1541 shortboard the chip is UC3, and on the long board it's UAB1.

If you choose to use the connector to press the IDC connector and don't want to use a 15 pin cable wasting 7 wires, you can hook it up like this.
